We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

## Key note

* The master key and revocation certificate should be encrypted with
  symmetric encryption and stored safely in an encrypted volume on
  separate USB thumb drives.
* These thumb drives should eventually be stored in a secret safe which
  only you have access to. Hopefully, our master keys shall never see
  the light again.
* The sub-keys are meant for daily use.
* In case your sub-keys get compromised, rush to the safe, get the USB
  thumb drive out, and revoke the sub keys. This preserves our identify
  in the web of trust.
* Youâ€™ll revoke those sub-keys using the master key, not the revocation
  certificate.
* The revocation certificate is used to revoke the master key only
  (that's the reason we are storing them on a separate thumb drive).
